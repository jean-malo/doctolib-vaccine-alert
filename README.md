# doctolib-vaccine-alert
Bot that scrapes Doctolib to find available vaccination time slots

Have a look at [settings.py](./src/settings.py) and [.env.example](.env.example) for the available settings.

You should add the relevant env vars before running the script.

ðŸš§ This was built in a few hours so excuse the code quality, I will improve it and add more features when I have more time.  

While it was designed for vaccines if you modify the query by changing `DOCTOLIB_SEARCH_URL` in `settings.py` you could fetch appointments for any city & any subject. 

## Run locally
